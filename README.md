# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
Implementing a 3 layer neural network from scratch.

First we are using Logistic regression to fit a linear line to classify and then we are comparing it by the neural network we build from scratch using numpy. Implementing a network from scratch at least once is an extremely valuable exercise. It helps you gain an understanding of how neural networks work, and that is essential for designing effective models.

# Dataset
Dataset is generated randomly.
You can think of the blue dots as male patients and the red dots as female patients, with the x- and y- axis being medical measurements.
