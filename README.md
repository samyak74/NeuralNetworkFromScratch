# Introduction
An Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), popularly known as Neural Network is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. It is like an artificial human nervous system for receiving, processing, and transmitting information in terms of Computer Science.

Basically, there are 3 different layers in a neural network :-

1. Input Layer (All the inputs are fed in the model through this layer)
2. Hidden Layers (There can be more than one hidden layers which are used for processing the inputs received from the input layers)
3. Output Layer (The data after processing is made available at the output layer)

# Neural Network From Scratch
Implementing a 3 layer neural network from scratch.

First we are using Logistic regression to fit a linear line to classify and then we are comparing it by the neural network we build from scratch using numpy. Implementing a network from scratch at least once is an extremely valuable exercise. It helps you gain an understanding of how neural networks work, and that is essential for designing effective models.

# Dataset
Dataset is generated randomly.
You can think of the blue dots as male patients and the red dots as female patients, with the x- and y- axis being medical measurements.

# Tuning 
You can tune the hyperparameters, use different activation function, use another implementation of gradient descent, use more number of hidden layers and hidden neurons to get different results.
